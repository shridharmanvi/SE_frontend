# SE_frontend

Findout - The sentiment analysis app:

An android application that shows public sentiment	about	potential	candidates for the 2016 US Presidential elections.
It performs	classification on tweets related to the	candidate	and	analyzes the sentiment of each	
tweet	to display the overall popularity of a candidate.It is built using technologies like AWS, flask, android mongoDB, data analysis
and	classification using python etc.

SE_frontend consists of the front end android code and SE_backend consists of the backend.

The code is hosted on AWS instance:
http://54.69.180.213/findout/<candidate name>

Ex:
http://54.69.180.213/findout/ted cruz
This link returns positive and negative sentiment percentage, popularity trend over last five days and a link to the word cloud
about what is being talked most about the candidate. 

Planing to come up with a web interface soon. Feedback and comments welcome.
